This code is provided with no gaurantees.  This is a C# library created to allow you to consume microsoft sql server select statements, break them into components and store those components in enumerable and queryable collections.  This will allow you to search through sql statements using all the power of LINQ to find any fields or tables you are interested in and make changes.  It will also allow you to create sql select statements from scratch, or add and remove clauses of all kinds.
